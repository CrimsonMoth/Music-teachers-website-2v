I decided to try to use Bootstrap for Nav and more. Actually, I've been always thinking that Bootstrap is too limits the imagination and creation.
I'm not even sure if I still use it. It's good then you create hundreds of simillar websites but if you create one I guess you can take something from BS but not all, it's going to better create the rest yourself. 
I've added 2  BS sliders. It looks good I think
