I decided to try to use Bootstrap for Nav and more. Actually, I've been always thinking that Bootstrap is too limits the imagination and creation.
I'm not even sure if I still use it. It's good then you create hundreds of simillar websites but if you create one I guess it going to better create everything yourself.
